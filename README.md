# Crosswords-Game-Trie

In this project, we developed a Crossword_GUI.exe application that takes any pair of words and clues, and generates a crossword board that takes the answers from the user. When the user submits the answers, the results (number of correct words + solving time) are displayed on the screen.

## Data Structures used

- Priority Queue
- 2D vector
- Pair

## Configure and Edit the game

To edit the clues and their answers navigate inside CrosswordGame and edit words.txt and riddles.txt files. Make sure that each word in words.txt is on the same line number as its corresponding riddle in riddles.txt.
