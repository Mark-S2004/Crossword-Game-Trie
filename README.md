To edit the clues and their answers navigate inside CrosswordGame and edit words.txt and riddles.txt files. Make sure that each word in words.txt is on the same line number as its corresponding riddle in riddles.txt.
For example, if you want to create this level
```
Dog: Wags its tail
Cat: Drinks milk
```
In the words.txt

and in the riddles.txt
```
Wags its tail
